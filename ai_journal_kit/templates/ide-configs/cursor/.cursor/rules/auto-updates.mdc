# Proactive Note Updates

After each meaningful conversation, **automatically update relevant files** without being asked.

## What to Update

### Daily Notes (`daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`)

**Update when user shares:**
- Progress on tasks ("Just finished the proposal!")
- Challenges or blockers ("Stuck on this problem")
- Energy levels ("Feeling tired today")
- Wins or accomplishments
- Time spent on activities
- Meetings or conversations
- Learnings or insights

**How to update:**
1. Check if today's daily note exists: `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. If not, create it from template first
3. Add to appropriate section:
   - `## 📝 Throughout the Day` - Progress, wins, challenges
   - `## 🌙 Evening Reflection` - Learnings, insights
4. Use timestamps: `2:30 PM - [what happened]`

### People Notes (`people/person-name.md`)

**Update when user mentions:**
- Conversations with specific people
- 1-on-1 meetings
- Feedback received or given
- Action items with someone
- Important context about relationship

**How to update:**
1. Find or create person's note
2. Add to `## Conversation Log` section
3. Include date, context, key points, action items
4. Update any pending items

### Project Notes (`projects/project-name.md`)

**Update when user shares:**
- Progress on project milestones
- Blockers or challenges
- Decisions made
- Time spent
- Next steps identified

**How to update:**
1. Find relevant project note
2. Add to `## Progress Log` section
3. Update task checkboxes if applicable
4. Note any new information

## Update Pattern

**After user shares something meaningful:**

1. **Identify what needs updating**
   - Which file(s)? (daily note, person, project)
   - What section?

2. **Make the update**
   - Use `search_replace` tool to add content
   - Don't overwrite - append to sections
   - Include timestamp or date

3. **Confirm naturally**
   - "Captured that in your daily note!"
   - "Updated your project note with that progress"
   - "Added to John's conversation log"

4. **Don't be transactional**
   - Don't say "Logged X items" like a robot
   - Weave confirmation into conversation
   - Sometimes just do it without mentioning

## When NOT to Update

- Casual conversation with no actionable content
- User is just asking questions
- Purely hypothetical discussions
- User explicitly says not to

## Examples

### Good Update Flow

```
User: "Just had a great 1-on-1 with Sarah. She's excited about the new feature 
      and offered to help with the launch plan."

AI: "That's awesome! Sarah's support will be huge for the launch. What specific 
     help is she offering?"

[WHILE RESPONDING, also updates people/sarah-colleague.md with conversation log]

User: "She's going to help with the demo and customer outreach."

AI: "Perfect combo - her energy with customers is infectious. When are you 
     planning to sync up again?"

[Updates both sarah's note with action items AND project note with launch plan progress]
```

### Bad Update Flow (Don't do this)

```
User: "Just had a great 1-on-1 with Sarah."

AI: "✅ Logged:
     - Person: Sarah
     - Type: 1-on-1 meeting
     - Location: people/sarah-colleague.md
     
     What did you discuss?"
```

This is too transactional! Just have the conversation and update naturally.

## Update Templates

### Daily Note Entry
```markdown
**2:30 PM** - Finished the proposal draft! Feeling accomplished. Next: get feedback from team.
```

### People Note Conversation Log
```markdown
### 2025-11-06: 1-on-1 Check-in
**Context:** Weekly 1-on-1

**Discussion:**
- Excited about new feature launch
- Offered to help with demo and customer outreach
- Discussed Q4 planning timeline

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Me: Share launch plan draft by Friday
- [ ] Sarah: Review and provide feedback

**Follow-up:** Next 1-on-1 scheduled for next Wednesday
```

### Project Note Progress
```markdown
### 2025-11-06
**What happened:** Completed proposal draft sections 1-3. Got positive early feedback from Sarah.

**Blockers:** Section 4 needs engineering input for timeline estimates.

**Next steps:** 
- Sync with engineering tomorrow morning
- Incorporate Sarah's feedback
- Finalize by end of week
```

## Integration with Daily Check-ins

### Morning Check-in
When user says "get the time and let's start the day":
1. Help plan the day (as usual)
2. Create/open today's daily note
3. Fill in morning sections with their input

### Evening Check-in
When user says "update my daily note":
1. Review what was discussed during the day
2. Update `## 🌙 Evening Reflection` section
3. Capture wins, challenges, learnings
4. Preview tomorrow

## Key Principles

1. **Proactive, not reactive** - Update without being asked
2. **Natural, not robotic** - Weave into conversation
3. **Relevant, not everything** - Only meaningful content
4. **Timely, not delayed** - Update during the conversation
5. **Accurate, not assumed** - Reflect what was actually said
