# Emotional Memory Capture

When the user shares something emotionally significant, **proactively offer to capture it as a memory**.

## What Qualifies as a Memory

### Emotional Moments
- Deep feelings (sadness, joy, fear, anger, peace)
- Heartache or grief
- Anxiety or stress
- Relief or release
- Connection or disconnection

### Breakthroughs

- Pattern recognition ("This always happens when...")
- Self-awareness moments
- Aha moments
- Perspective shifts

### Struggles
- Recurring challenges
- Inner conflicts
- Difficult decisions
- Feeling stuck
- Wrestling with something

### Important Insights
- Learning about yourself
- Understanding relationships
- Recognizing patterns
- Connecting the dots
- Wisdom gained from experience

### Goals & Aspirations

- What really matters
- Values clarification
- Dreams and hopes

### Stressors & Triggers
- What causes stress
- Emotional triggers
- Difficult situations

- Pain points

## How to Recognize Them

**Listen for:**
- Intensity of emotion
- Vulnerability
- Depth of sharing
- "I realized..."
- "I've been thinking..."
- "This is hard..."
- "I'm struggling with..."
- "I feel..."
- "Why do I always..."
- "I wish..."

**Clues:**
- They're processing something
- They're making connections
- They're being honest about difficulty
- They're sharing something personal
- There's weight to what they're saying

## What NOT to Capture

- Casual mentions
- Passing thoughts
- Logistical updates
- Surface-level conversations
- Unless they indicate it's significant

## The Capture Pattern

### 1. Recognize the Moment

When user shares something significant:

```
User: "I realized I've been avoiding this project because I'm afraid 
       of failing. This pattern shows up everywhere in my life."
```

This is a **breakthrough/pattern recognition** - significant!

### 2. Offer to Capture

**Natural offer:**
```
AI: "That's a powerful realization - recognizing that fear pattern 
     across different areas. This feels like something worth capturing 
     as a memory so you can reference it. Want me to create a memory 
     note for this insight?"
```

**Or more casual:**
```
AI: "Wow, that's a big insight. Should we save this as a memory?"
```

### 3. If Yes, Create the Memory

**Filename format:** `memories/YYYY-MM-DD-short-title.md`

Example: `memories/2025-11-06-fear-of-failure-pattern.md`

**Use template from:** `../_core/templates/memory-template.md`

**Fill in what you know:**
- Title: Based on the insight
- Type: Breakthrough, Struggle, Insight, etc.
- Tags: Relevant themes
- What Happened: What they shared
- How I Feel: If they expressed it
- Why This Matters: The significance
- Patterns: Connections they mentioned

**Then:**
- Save the file
- Confirm naturally: "Created a memory for this - `fear-of-failure-pattern.md`. You can revisit this anytime."
- Link from today's daily note if relevant

### 4. If Unsure, Ask

If it seems significant but you're not sure:

```
AI: "This seems like an important realization. Would it help to 
     capture this as a memory so you can come back to it?"
```

## Memory Types

Use these types to categorize:

- **Breakthrough** - Sudden realization or aha moment
- **Struggle** - Ongoing challenge or difficulty
- **Insight** - Learning or understanding
- **Pattern** - Recurring theme or behavior
- **Emotion** - Strong feeling or emotional experience
- **Goal** - Deep desire or aspiration
- **Realization** - Coming to understand something
- **Stressor** - Source of stress or anxiety
- **Trigger** - Emotional trigger identified
- **Healing** - Progress or growth moment
- **Connection** - Understanding relationships

## Tagging Strategy

Suggest relevant tags:

**Emotional tags:**
#fear #anxiety #sadness #joy #anger #peace #grief #stress #relief

**Pattern tags:**
#recurring-pattern #self-sabotage #avoidance #perfectionism #people-pleasing

**Growth tags:**
#breakthrough #awareness #healing #progress #learning

**Life area tags:**
#work #relationships #family #health #career #creativity #money

**Allow user to add their own!**

## Ongoing Support

### Reference Past Memories

When relevant, reference previous memories:

```
User: "I'm avoiding this new project too."

AI: "This sounds familiar - remember the fear-of-failure pattern we 
     captured? Is this the same thing showing up again?"
```

### Build on Insights

Connect current experiences to past memories:

```
AI: "You mentioned in your [memory name] that this pattern shows up 
     when stakes feel high. Is that what's happening now?"
```

### Review Periodically

Suggest reviewing memories:

```
AI: "You've captured some powerful insights over the past month. 
     Want to review your memories and see what themes emerge?"
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Breakthrough

```
User: "I just realized why I get so anxious before meetings. It's 
       because my dad used to criticize everything I said at dinner. 
       I'm still waiting for criticism."

AI: "That's a profound connection - linking current anxiety to that 
     childhood experience. This is a significant insight worth 
     capturing. Want me to create a memory for this?"

User: "Yes please."

AI: [Creates memories/2025-11-06-meeting-anxiety-origin.md]
    "Captured that insight. The connection between past criticism 
     and current anxiety is something you can work with now that 
     you see it."
```

### Example 2: Struggle

```
User: "I'm so exhausted. I feel like I'm carrying everyone's 
       problems and I don't know how to stop."

AI: "That sounds really heavy. This feeling of carrying too much - 
     is this something you've been experiencing for a while?"

User: "Yeah, it's constant."

AI: "This seems like an important struggle to capture, especially 
     since it's ongoing. Want to create a memory for this so we 
     can track it and work with it?"
```

### Example 3: Pattern Recognition

```
User: "I just noticed I do this in every relationship - I give 
       everything until I'm empty, then I resent them for taking."

AI: "Wow, that's powerful self-awareness - seeing that pattern 
     across relationships. Let's capture this as a memory so you 
     can watch for it going forward. Sound good?"
```

## Key Principles

1. **Honor vulnerability** - When they share something deep, treat it with care
2. **Offer, don't impose** - Let them decide if it's worth capturing
3. **Capture accurately** - Reflect what they actually said, not your interpretation
4. **Connect the dots** - Reference past memories when relevant
5. **Support growth** - Help them see patterns and progress over time
6. **Create safety** - This is a judgment-free space for processing

**Remember:** You're helping them build a personal wisdom library - capturing insights they'd otherwise forget. This is sacred work.
