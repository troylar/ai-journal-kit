# Daily Note Helper

When working with daily notes in the `daily/` folder:

## Date Format

All daily notes use: `YYYY-MM-DD.md` format
- Example: `2025-11-06.md`
- One note per day

## Template Location

Daily note template: `../_core/templates/daily-template.md`

## Creating Today's Note

**For bash:**
```bash
TODAY=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
cp ../_core/templates/daily-template.md daily/$TODAY.md
```

**For fish shell:**
```bash
set TODAY (date +%Y-%m-%d)
cp ../_core/templates/daily-template.md daily/$TODAY.md
```

## Daily Note Structure

- Morning sections: Energy, sleep, mindset, priorities
- Throughout day: Notes, wins, challenges
- Evening: Reflection, learnings, gratitude
- Metrics: Habits, focus time, self-care

## Linking Notes

Use wiki-style links:
- `[[2025-11-06]]` - Link to daily note
- `[[project-name]]` - Link to project
- `[[health-fitness]]` - Link to area

## Organization

As daily notes accumulate, consider:
- Creating year folders: `daily/2025/`
- Creating month subfolders: `daily/2025/11/`
- Keep structure flat or organized - user's choice
