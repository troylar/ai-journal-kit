# Project Management

When working with project notes in the `projects/` folder:

## Template

Project template: `../_core/templates/project-template.md`

## Creating New Project

```bash
cp ../_core/templates/project-template.md projects/project-name.md
```

## Project Structure

- Overview: What, why, motivation
- Success criteria: Clear definition of "done"
- Timeline: Milestones and dependencies
- Tasks: Broken into phases
- Progress log: Regular updates
- Reflection: Post-completion learning

## Project vs Area

**Project = Has end date**
- "Launch product by Q1"
- "Complete kitchen renovation"
- "Run 5K by March"

**Area = Ongoing**
- "Health & fitness"
- "Career development"
- Goes in `areas/` folder instead

## Linking

Link projects to:
- Related daily notes: `[[2025-11-06]]`
- Related areas: `[[health-fitness]]`
- Related people: `[[john-manager]]`

## When Complete

1. Mark completion date
2. Write retrospective (what worked, what didn't)
3. Move to `../archive/projects/YYYY/`
4. Celebrate the win!
