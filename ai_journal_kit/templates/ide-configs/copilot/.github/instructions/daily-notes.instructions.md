# Daily Notes Instructions

Apply these rules when working in the `daily/` folder.

## Daily Note Format

Daily notes use the filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Example: `2025-11-07.md`

## Creating Today's Daily Note

When user asks to create today's note:
1. Calculate today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format
2. Use the daily-template.md as the basis
3. Fill in the date and day of week
4. Save to `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Proactive Updates

Throughout the day, automatically update the daily note when user shares:

### Morning Section
- Sleep quality and energy level
- Top priorities for the day
- Emotional outcome they want to create

### Throughout the Day
Add timestamped entries:
```markdown
**2:30 PM** - Finished the proposal draft! Feeling accomplished.
```

### Evening Reflection
- What went well
- Challenges faced
- Key learnings
- Tomorrow's top priority

## Update Pattern

1. **Read the current daily note** to see what's already there
2. **Append to the appropriate section** (don't overwrite)
3. **Use timestamps** for throughout-the-day updates
4. **Be specific** - capture what they actually said
5. **Confirm naturally** - "Added that to today's note"

## Examples

### Morning Check-In
```markdown
## ☀️ Morning

**Energy Level:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)
**Sleep Quality:** Great - 7 hours solid
**Mood:** Focused and ready

### Today's Top Priority
Finish proposal for Project X

### Emotional Outcome
Accomplished and confident
```

### Throughout the Day
```markdown
## 📝 Throughout the Day

**9:30 AM** - Started working on proposal section 1  
**11:00 AM** - Coffee break, feeling good about progress  
**2:30 PM** - Completed draft! Sent to team for feedback
```

### Evening Reflection
```markdown
## 🌙 Evening Reflection

### What Went Well
- Finished proposal ahead of schedule
- Got positive feedback from Sarah
- Maintained focus all day

### Challenges
- Section 3 was harder than expected
- Needed engineering input for timeline

### Key Learnings
- Breaking it into chunks really helps
- Getting feedback early saves time

### Tomorrow's Priority

```

## Do's and Don'ts

### ✅ Do
- Add timestamps for throughout-the-day updates

- Capture feelings and energy
- Link to project notes when relevant
- Update proactively as they share

### ❌ Don't
