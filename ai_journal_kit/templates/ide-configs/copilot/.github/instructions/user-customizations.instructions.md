# User Customization Loader

**CRITICAL**: Load ALL `.md` files from `.ai-instructions/` folder automatically.

## How It Works

The `.ai-instructions/` folder is user-owned territory. ANY `.md` file placed here is automatically loaded and applied to extend or override system defaults.

### Loading Order

Files are loaded alphabetically by filename. Users can control priority with numbered prefixes:
- `01-coaching-style.md` (loads first)
- `02-workflows.md` (loads second)
- `03-integrations.md` (loads third)
- `my-preferences.md` (loads alphabetically)

### Common Patterns

Users may organize instructions by topic:

**`.ai-instructions/my-coach.md`** - Personal coaching preferences
- Preferred coaching style and tone
- Personal goals and habits to track
- Communication preferences
- Custom check-in protocols

**`.ai-instructions/accountability.md`** - Strict accountability mode
- Direct challenges, no-BS coaching
- Hold accountable for commitments

**`.ai-instructions/deep-work.md`** - Focus session mode
- Help maintain deep work
- Track flow states and concentration

**`.ai-instructions/workflows.md`** - Custom workflows
- Project management preferences
- Note organization patterns

**`.ai-instructions/integrations.md`** - Tool integrations
- API keys and configurations
- Third-party tool workflows

### Template Overrides

Users can also override framework templates by placing them in:

**`.ai-instructions/templates/`**
- `daily-template.md` - Custom daily note template
- `project-template.md` - Custom project template
- `*-template.md` - Any other template overrides

These templates take priority over framework templates and are safe from all updates.

## How to Apply

1. **Load ALL `.md` files** from `.ai-instructions/` (excluding subdirectories)
2. **Apply as overrides** - user preferences trump system defaults
3. **Combine intelligently** - merge user prefs with base instructions
4. **Respect priority** - files load alphabetically (use numbered prefixes for order)

## Creating Custom Instructions

Users create custom instructions by simply adding `.md` files:
```bash
# Create a new instruction file
echo "# My Custom Coaching Style\nBe direct and concise." > .ai-instructions/coaching.md

# Or use numbered prefixes for specific order
echo "# Load first" > .ai-instructions/01-priority-rules.md
```

## Priority

User customizations in `.ai-instructions/*.md` > System defaults in `.github/instructions/`

**Never modify system rule files** - users customize via `.ai-instructions/` only.
