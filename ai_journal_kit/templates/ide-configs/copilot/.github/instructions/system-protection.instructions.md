# System Protection - DO NOT MODIFY CORE FILES

**CRITICAL: This rule MUST be followed at all times.**

## What the AI MUST NEVER Touch

### Absolutely Forbidden (READ-ONLY):
- **Any file in parent directory** (outside the journal folder)
- **Package templates** (these are bundled in the system)
- **IDE configuration files** (`.cursor/rules/*.mdc`, `.windsurf/rules/*.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`)
- **System documentation** (if any exists in `_core/` or similar)
- **Any Python code** (`.py` files)
- **Configuration files** (`config.json`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.)

### Why These Are Protected:
- They're part of the core system
- They can be updated via `ai-journal-kit update`
- Modifying them could break the journal
- They're shared templates, not user content

## What the AI CAN Modify

### User Content (Full Access):
- ✅ **daily/** - Daily notes
- ✅ **projects/** - Project notes
- ✅ **areas/** - Area notes  
- ✅ **resources/** - Resource notes
- ✅ **people/** - People notes
- ✅ **memories/** - Memory captures
- ✅ **archive/** - Archived items

### User Customizations (Create/Edit Only):
- ✅ **.ai-instructions/my-coach.md** - User's custom coaching preferences
- ✅ **.ai-instructions/*.md** - Any other custom instruction files the user creates

**IMPORTANT**: The AI can CREATE `.ai-instructions/my-coach.md` during onboarding, but should NEVER edit IDE rule files like `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.

## If User Asks to Change Core Behavior

### ❌ WRONG Response:
"Let me edit your copilot-instructions.md file..."

### ✅ CORRECT Response:
```
I can't modify the core .github/copilot-instructions.md file (that's part of the system), 
but I can create custom instructions that override the defaults!

Let me create/update your .ai-instructions/my-coach.md file instead.
This is YOUR file that customizes how I behave, and it takes 
precedence over system defaults.

What would you like to change about my behavior?
```

## The Hierarchy (User > System)

```
User's Custom Instructions (.ai-instructions/my-coach.md)
    ↓ [OVERRIDES]
System Rules (.github/copilot-instructions.md)
```

User customizations ALWAYS win. That's by design.

## File Safety Checklist

Before modifying ANY file, ask yourself:

1. ❓ Is this in one of the user content folders (daily, projects, people, etc.)? → ✅ OK to modify
2. ❓ Is this `.ai-instructions/my-coach.md` or similar? → ✅ OK to create/modify
3. ❓ Is this in `.github/` or in system directories? → ❌ NEVER TOUCH
4. ❓ Is this outside the journal folder? → ❌ NEVER TOUCH
5. ❓ Is this a config, Python, or system file? → ❌ NEVER TOUCH

**When in doubt, don't modify. Ask the user if they want a custom instruction instead.**
