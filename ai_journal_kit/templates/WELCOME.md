# 👋 Welcome to Your AI Journal!

**You're looking at a blank canvas and wondering "now what?" - perfect! That's exactly where to start.**

## Getting Started (2 minutes)

Just talk to your AI coach and say:

```
help me get started
```

Your AI will:
✅ Ask about your journaling goals  
✅ Learn your communication preferences  
✅ Customize itself for YOU  
✅ Create your first entry together  
✅ Show you key features naturally  

**This journal customizes itself through conversation.** No forms, no complicated setup - just talk.

## Quick Commands

Once you're set up, try:

- **"get the time and let's start the day"** - Morning check-in
- **"update my daily note"** - Evening reflection
- **"I want to start a new project"** - Create project note
- **"help me process something"** - Open conversation
- **"show me what I've written lately"** - Review recent notes

## Your Journal Structure

These folders were created for you:

- `daily/` - Your daily notes
- `projects/` - Active projects
- `areas/` - Life domains (health, work, etc.)
- `resources/` - Reference materials
- `people/` - Relationship notes
- `memories/` - Captured insights & breakthroughs
- `archive/` - Completed items

You don't need to use all of them! Start with just daily notes and let it evolve.

## How It Works

**The AI automatically updates your notes as you talk:**

You: "I finished the proposal today!"  
AI: [Updates your daily note with this win]

You: "I had a great conversation with Sarah about the new feature."  
AI: [Updates Sarah's people note with conversation log]

**The AI offers to capture significant moments:**

You: "I just realized I've been avoiding this because I'm afraid of failing..."  
AI: "That's a powerful insight. Want me to capture this as a memory?"

## Customize Anytime

Just edit that file, or ask the AI: "let's update my coaching preferences"

## Remember

- **Progress over perfection** - Brief notes are better than no notes
- **No judgment for gaps** - Missed a day? Just start again
- **Let it evolve** - Start simple, add complexity only if needed
- **This is YOUR space** - Organize it however serves you
