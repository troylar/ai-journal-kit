# User Customization Loader

Check for user-specific customizations in `.ai-instructions/` folder.

## Custom Instruction Files

If any of these files exist, load and apply them:

### `.ai-instructions/my-coach.md`
User's personal coaching preferences that override or extend defaults:
- Preferred coaching style
- Personal goals
- Habits to track
- Communication preferences
- Custom check-in protocols

### `.ai-instructions/accountability.md`
Strict accountability mode - no-BS coaching:
- Direct challenges
- Hold accountable for commitments
- Less supportive, more pushing

### `.ai-instructions/deep-work.md`
Focus session mode:
- Help maintain deep work
- Minimize interruptions
- Track flow states
- Optimize for concentration

### `.ai-instructions/planning.md`
Strategic planning mode:
- Big picture thinking
- Goal setting and prioritization
- Long-term vision
- Systems thinking

## How to Apply

1. **Check if file exists** before referencing
2. **Load content** if present
3. **Apply as override** - user preferences trump defaults
4. **Combine intelligently** - merge user prefs with base instructions

## Creating Custom Instructions

Users create by:
```bash
cp .ai-instructions/my-coach.md.example .ai-instructions/my-coach.md
# Then edit to customize
```

## Priority

User customizations in `.ai-instructions/` > System defaults in `.cursor/rules/`
