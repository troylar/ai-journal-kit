# Resources

Reference material, guides, notes, and useful information you want to keep.

## What is a Resource?

A resource is information you want to reference later:
- **Reference material** (doesn't require action)
- **Guides and how-tos**
- **Book notes and learnings**
- **Templates and frameworks**
- **Useful links and tools**

## Examples

**Good resources:**
- `book-notes.md` - Notes from books you've read
- `recipes.md` - Cooking recipes you love
- `workout-routines.md` - Exercise programs
- `meeting-templates.md` - Templates for different meeting types
- `useful-tools.md` - Software, apps, and tools you use
- `python-cheatsheet.md` - Quick reference for Python syntax

**Not resources:**
- Active projects (goes in projects/)
- Ongoing responsibilities (goes in areas/)
- Daily thoughts (goes in daily/)

## Organization Options

### Option 1: Flat Structure (Simple)
```
resources/
├── book-notes.md
├── recipes.md
├── workout-routines.md
└── useful-tools.md
```

### Option 2: By Category (Organized)
```
resources/
├── learning/
│   ├── book-notes.md
│   ├── course-notes.md
│   └── python-cheatsheet.md
├── health/
│   ├── recipes.md
│   ├── workout-routines.md
│   └── meal-plans.md
├── work/
│   ├── meeting-templates.md
│   ├── email-templates.md
│   └── presentation-frameworks.md
└── tools/
    ├── useful-software.md
    └── productivity-apps.md
```

### Option 3: By Type (Flexible)
```
resources/
├── templates/
├── guides/
├── notes/
├── links/
└── cheatsheets/
```

Choose what works for you.

## Creating Resources

### Capture as You Go
When you find something useful:
1. Create a new resource note
2. Add the key information
3. Link from relevant projects/areas
4. Tag for easy finding later

### Organize Later
Don't let organization block capture:
- Capture first, organize later
- Use search to find things
- Reorganize when structure emerges

### Link Liberally
Connect resources to:
- Related projects
- Related areas  
- Other resources
- Daily notes where relevant

## Tips for Success

### Keep Resources Actionable
Add these sections to make resources useful:
- **When to use this**
- **Key takeaways**
- **How to apply**
- **Examples**

### Update Over Time
Resources are living documents:
- Add new learnings
- Update based on experience
- Remove outdated information
- Refine based on use

### Make Them Findable
Use clear, descriptive names:
- ❌ `notes.md` (too vague)
- ✅ `python-pandas-cheatsheet.md` (specific)

### Link to Daily Notes
When you use a resource, reference it:
- "Used [[workout-routines]] for today's gym session"
- "Applied framework from [[meeting-templates]] in client call"

## Resource Template

For structured resources, use this format:

```markdown
# Resource: [Name]

**Type:** Book Notes / Guide / Template / Reference  
**Created:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Last Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Source:** [Link or reference]

## Overview

## Integration with AI Coach

When working with an AI coach:

**Capture:** "I want to save this as a resource: [content]"  
→ Coach helps you structure and file it

**Retrieve:** "What do my notes say about [topic]?"  
→ Coach searches your resources

**Apply:** "How can I use [resource] for [situation]?"  
→ Coach helps you apply learnings

## Maintenance

### Monthly Review
- Are resources up to date?
- Should any be archived?
- Are they well-organized?
- Are there gaps to fill?

### Quarterly Cleanup
- Archive outdated resources
- Merge similar resources
- Update frequently-used resources
- Improve organization

Start simple: Create resources as you need them, organize as patterns emerge.
