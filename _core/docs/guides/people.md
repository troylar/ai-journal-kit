Notes about relationships, conversations, and connections.

## What is a People Note?

A people note helps you:
- Remember important conversations
- Track relationship context
- Prepare for 1-on-1 meetings
- Maintain meaningful connections
- Show you care by remembering details

## Examples

**Good people notes:**
- `john-smith-manager.md` - Your manager
- `sarah-colleague.md` - Close work colleague
- `mom.md` - Family member
- `alex-mentor.md` - Your mentor
- `client-acme-corp.md` - Key client contact

**Not people notes:**
- Meeting notes (can link to people though)
- General networking tips (goes in resources/)

## Privacy & Ethics

### Keep It Professional
- Focus on work context and professional growth
- Avoid deeply personal or sensitive information
- Remember: These are YOUR notes about interactions

### Be Respectful
- Write notes you'd be comfortable with them seeing
- Focus on positive and neutral context
- Avoid gossip or negativity

### Consider Security
- Don't store sensitive personal data
- Be mindful of what you commit to cloud/git
- Use initials if privacy is a concern

## Use Cases

### 1-on-1 Meeting Prep
Review the person's note before meeting:
- What did we discuss last time?
- What follow-ups are pending?
- What do I want to cover today?

### Relationship Maintenance
Use people notes to:
- Remember birthdays and important dates
- Track conversation topics they care about
- Note their goals and challenges
- Remember to check in regularly

### Career Development
For manager/mentor relationships:
- Track feedback and guidance
- Document career goals discussed
- Note commitments and action items
- Show progress over time

### Client Management
For key client relationships:
- Remember project context
- Track their priorities and concerns
- Note communication preferences
- Maintain continuity across interactions

## Tips for Success

### Keep It Current
- Update after each significant interaction
- Don't wait to remember details later
- Quick notes are better than detailed later

### Be Actionable
Include sections for:
- Pending follow-ups
- Commitments made
- Next scheduled interaction
- Topics to discuss next time

### Focus on Patterns
Look for recurring themes:
- What do they care about?
- What challenges do they face?
- How can you help?
- What's their communication style?

### Regular Review
- **Before meetings:** Review their note
- **Weekly:** Check for pending follow-ups
- **Monthly:** Review key relationships
- **Quarterly:** Reflect on relationship quality

## Integration with AI Coach

When working with an AI coach:

**Before Meeting:** "I have a 1-on-1 with [person] tomorrow"  
→ Coach helps you prepare based on their note

**After Meeting:** "Update [[person-name]] with today's conversation"  
→ Coach helps capture key points and action items

**Relationship Check:** "How am I doing with my key relationships?"  
→ Coach reviews your people notes and suggests check-ins

## Conversation Log Format

Use this format for conversation logs:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD: [Meeting or Topic]
**Context:** [Where/why this conversation happened]

**Discussion:**
- Key point 1
- Key point 2
- Key point 3

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Me: [What I need to do]
- [ ] Them: [What they need to do]

**Follow-up:** [When/how to follow up]
```
