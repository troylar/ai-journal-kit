# Daily Notes

One note per day, using the format: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Purpose

Daily notes are your workspace for:
- Morning planning and intention setting
- Task tracking throughout the day  
- Capturing thoughts, ideas, and reflections
- Evening reflection and learning
- Habit tracking and accountability

## Getting Started

1. **Copy the template** from `../system/daily-template.md`
2. **Rename** to today's date: `2025-11-06.md`
3. **Fill in** the morning sections to start your day
4. **Update** throughout the day as needed
5. **Complete** the evening reflection before bed

## Organization Options

### Option 1: Flat Structure (Simple)
```
daily/
├── 2025-11-06.md
├── 2025-11-07.md
├── 2025-11-08.md
└── ...
```

### Option 2: Year/Month Folders (Organized)
```
daily/
├── 2025/
│   ├── 11/
│   │   ├── 2025-11-06.md
│   │   ├── 2025-11-07.md
│   │   └── 2025-11-08.md
│   └── 12/
│       └── ...
└── 2024/
    └── ...
```

Choose the structure that works best for you. Start simple (flat) and reorganize later if needed.

## Tips for Success

### Morning Routine
- Fill this out BEFORE starting work
- Set 3 priorities maximum (not 10)
- Define your emotional outcome for the day
- Review yesterday's note for continuity

### Throughout the Day
- Don't wait until evening to fill everything
- Capture thoughts and progress in real-time
- Use it as a scratchpad for ideas
- Link to relevant projects and resources

### Evening Reflection
- Spend 5-10 minutes reviewing
- Focus on learning, not just completion
- Celebrate small wins
- Set tomorrow's top priority

### Consistency Tips
- Same time each day helps build habit
- Brief notes are better than no notes
- Missing a day is fine - just start again
- Use AI coach for accountability

**Q: Do I need to fill out every section?**  
A: No! Use what's helpful, skip what's not. The template is a starting point.

**Q: Can I customize the template?**  
A: Absolutely! Edit `../system/daily-template.md` to fit your needs.

**Q: How long should this take?**  
A: Morning: 5-10 minutes. Evening: 5-10 minutes. Throughout day: as needed.

**Q: What if I work nights or odd hours?**

## Integration with AI Coach

If you're using an AI coach:

**Morning:** "Get the time and let's start the day"  
→ Coach will help you fill out the morning sections

**Throughout Day:** Share your progress and challenges  
→ Coach will help you stay focused and overcome obstacles

**Evening:** "Update my daily note with today's progress"  
→ Coach will help you reflect and capture learnings
