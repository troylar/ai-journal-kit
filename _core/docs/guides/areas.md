# Areas

Ongoing areas of responsibility with no end date.

## What is an Area?

An area is something you maintain over time that:
- Has **no end date** (ongoing responsibility)
- Requires **consistent attention**
- Has **standards to maintain**
- Is part of your **identity or role**

## Examples

**Good areas:**
- `health-fitness.md` - Ongoing health and wellness
- `career-development.md` - Professional growth
- `family-relationships.md` - Maintaining family connections
- `financial-management.md` - Personal finances
- `home-maintenance.md` - Keeping home in good condition

**Not areas (these are Projects):**
- Run a 5K by March *(has end date - this is a project)*
- Home renovation *(has end date - this is a project)*
- Learn Python *(has end date - this is a project)*

## Area Template

Copy `../system/area-template.md` to create new areas.

## Area Structure

Each area note should include:
1. **Purpose** - Why this area matters
2. **Standards** - What "good" looks like
3. **Current State** - Where things stand now
4. **Active Projects** - Related time-bound projects
5. **Resources** - Guides, tools, reference material
6. **Regular Actions** - Recurring tasks and reviews

## Managing Areas

### Create a New Area
1. Copy `../system/area-template.md`
2. Rename to your area: `my-area.md`
3. Define purpose and standards
4. Link related projects and resources
5. Set up regular review schedule

### Maintain Areas
- **Weekly:** Quick check-in on high-priority areas
- **Monthly:** Deeper review of all areas
- **Quarterly:** Assess standards and priorities
- Link from daily notes when relevant

### Avoid Area Bloat
- **Too many areas** = nothing gets attention
- **Merge similar areas** if they overlap
- **Archive inactive areas** if no longer relevant
- **Focus on 5-10 core areas** maximum

## Organization Options

### Option 1: Flat Structure (Simple)
```
areas/
├── health-fitness.md
├── career-development.md
├── family-relationships.md
└── financial-management.md
```

### Option 2: Life Domains (Organized)
```
areas/
├── personal/
│   ├── health-fitness.md
│   └── personal-growth.md
├── professional/
│   ├── career-development.md
│   └── skill-building.md
└── relationships/
    ├── family.md
    └── friendships.md
```

Choose what works for you. Start simple.

## Tips for Success

### Define Clear Standards
Each area should have standards you're maintaining:

- **Career:** Learn one new skill per quarter, network monthly
- **Finances:** Track spending weekly, review budget monthly

### Connect Areas to Projects
Areas spawn projects:
- **Area:** Health & fitness
- **Projects:** Run 5K by March, meal prep system setup

### Regular Review Schedule
- **Daily:** Reference in daily notes as relevant
- **Weekly:** Check-in on 2-3 priority areas
- **Monthly:** Review all areas, adjust standards
- **Quarterly:** Deep reflection, reprioritize

### Use Daily Notes to Track
Reference areas in your daily notes:
- "[[health-fitness]]: Went to gym, feeling strong"
- "[[career-development]]: Completed leadership course module 3"

## Integration with AI Coach

When working with an AI coach:

**Check-in:** "How am I doing with [area-name]?"  
→ Coach reviews recent references and progress

**Stuck:** "I'm neglecting [area-name]"  
→ Coach helps identify why and create plan

**Standards:** "Help me set standards for [area-name]"  
→ Coach helps define what "good" looks like

## Monthly Review Prompts

Use these during your monthly area review:
- Am I meeting the standards I set for this area?
- What's going well? What needs attention?
- Are my standards realistic? Too high? Too low?
- What projects should I start to improve this area?
- Is this area still important to me?

## Weekly Priority Questions

For quick weekly check-ins:
- Which areas need attention this week?
- What's one small action I can take in each priority area?
- Are any areas being neglected? Why?
