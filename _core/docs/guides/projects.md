# Projects

Active projects with clear outcomes and end dates.

## What is a Project?

A project is something you're actively working on that:
- Has a **clear outcome** (you'll know when it's done)
- Has a **deadline** (target completion date)
- Requires **multiple steps** to complete
- Will be **finished** eventually (then moves to archive)

## Examples

**Good projects:**
- `product-launch.md` - Launching new feature by end of quarter
- `home-renovation.md` - Kitchen remodel project
- `learn-python.md` - Complete Python course by December
- `wedding-planning.md` - Get married on June 15th

**Not projects (these are Areas):**
- Health & fitness *(ongoing, no end date)*
- Career development *(ongoing responsibility)*
- Maintaining friendships *(continuous area)*

## Project Template

Copy `../system/project-template.md` to create new projects.

## Project Structure

Each project note should include:
1. **Overview** - What is this project? Why does it matter?
2. **Outcome** - What does success look like?
3. **Timeline** - Key dates and milestones
4. **Tasks** - What needs to be done
5. **Resources** - Links, notes, reference material
6. **Progress** - Regular updates and reflections

## Managing Projects

### Start a New Project
1. Copy `../system/project-template.md`
2. Rename to your project: `my-project.md`
3. Fill in the overview, outcome, and timeline
4. Break down into tasks
5. Link from relevant daily notes

### Track Progress
- Reference in daily notes: `Working on [[product-launch]] today`
- Update the project note regularly
- Check in during weekly reviews
- Celebrate milestones

### Complete a Project
1. Mark as complete in the note
2. Do a project retrospective (what worked, what didn't)
3. Move to `../archive/projects/`
4. Link any learnings to relevant areas

## Organization Options

### Option 1: Flat Structure (Simple)
```
projects/
├── product-launch.md
├── home-renovation.md
└── learn-python.md
```

### Option 2: Categorized (Organized)
```
projects/
├── work/
│   ├── product-launch.md
│   └── q4-planning.md
├── personal/
│   ├── home-renovation.md
│   └── learn-python.md
└── family/
    └── vacation-planning.md
```

### Option 3: By Status (Active Management)
```
projects/
├── active/
│   ├── product-launch.md
│   └── home-renovation.md
├── on-hold/
│   └── learn-python.md
└── completed/
    └── q3-review.md
```

Choose what works for you. Start simple and evolve.

## Tips for Success

### Keep Projects Focused
- **Too broad:** "Get in shape" (this is an area)
- **Better:** "Run a 5K by March 15th" (clear outcome, deadline)

### Limit Active Projects
- 3-5 active projects maximum
- Too many = nothing gets finished
- Be realistic about bandwidth

### Break Down Large Projects
If a project feels overwhelming:
- Create sub-projects
- Break into smaller milestones
- Focus on next immediate step only

### Link to Daily Notes
- Reference projects in daily planning
- Track progress in daily reflections
- Builds connection between day-to-day work and big goals

## Integration with AI Coach

When working with an AI coach:

**Starting:** "I'm starting a new project: [description]"  
→ Coach helps you define outcome and create plan

**Progress:** "Update on [project-name]"  
→ Coach asks about progress and obstacles

**Stuck:** "I'm stuck on [project-name]"  
→ Coach helps identify blockers and next steps

## Weekly Review Prompts

Use these during your weekly review:
- What progress did I make on each active project?
- What's blocking any projects?
- Are any projects stuck or stalled?
- Should any projects be paused or archived?
- What are next steps for each project?
