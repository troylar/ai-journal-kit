## 📝 Throughout the Day

### Notes & Thoughts
- Had a great insight during my morning walk - the proposal should focus on customer pain points FIRST, then our solution. Restructured the outline.
- Team meeting was productive. Sarah suggested adding a competitive analysis section - good call.
- Feeling energy dip around 3 PM. Grabbed a coffee and took a 5-minute walk outside. Helped a lot.

### Wins & Progress
- ✅ Finished proposal sections 1-3 (market analysis, problem statement, proposed solution)
- ✅ Got positive early feedback from Sarah on the approach
- ✅ Made it to the gym despite being tempted to skip
- ✅ Discovered that focusing on customer pain points makes the proposal stronger

### Challenges & Obstacles
- Section 4 (implementation timeline) is trickier than expected. Need to coordinate with engineering team for realistic estimates.
- Budget review didn't happen - meeting ran long and I prioritized proposal over admin work. Will tackle tomorrow morning.
- Almost skipped gym due to mental fatigue, but went anyway and felt better afterward.

## 🌙 Evening Reflection

### What Got Done Today
- [x] Priority 1: Complete product proposal draft *(sections 1-3 done, section 4 needs engineering input)*
- [x] Priority 2: 30-minute workout
- [ ] Priority 3: Review Q4 budget report *(pushed to tomorrow)*

### Energy Patterns
**High energy:** Morning (9-11 AM) and post-gym (6-7 PM)
**Low energy:** Mid-afternoon slump (2-3 PM)
**What influenced my energy?**
Good sleep helped me start strong. Coffee + short walk helped recover afternoon dip. Exercise boosted evening energy significantly.

### Key Learnings
**What did I learn today?**
1. Leading with customer pain points makes the proposal more compelling
2. Getting engineering input earlier would have saved time on section 4
3. Going to the gym even when I don't feel like it always improves my mood and energy

**What would I do differently tomorrow?**
- Block specific time to coordinate with engineering team on implementation timeline
- Take proactive 5-minute breaks every 90 minutes instead of waiting for energy to dip
- Start with the hardest task (budget review) when energy is highest

### Gratitude
**What am I grateful for today?**
1. Sarah's constructive feedback on the proposal - made it much better
2. Having the discipline to go to the gym even when tired
3. The clarity that came from restructuring the proposal around customer needs

### Tomorrow's Top Priority
**Finish section 4 of the proposal** by coordinating with the engineering team first thing in the morning.

## 📊 Daily Metrics (Optional)

### Habits
- [x] Morning routine (meditation + planning)
- [x] Exercise / Movement (strength training)
- [x] Deep work session(s) (2 hours)
- [x] Healthy eating (salad for lunch, home-cooked dinner)
- [ ] Reading / Learning (didn't get to it)
- [x] Evening wind-down (light stretching before bed)

### Focus Time
**Pomodoros completed:** 6

### Social / Relationships
Had a good conversation with Sarah about the proposal. She appreciated me asking for her input early.

### Self-Care
Gym session felt like an act of self-care, not just a task. Took a proper lunch break instead of eating at my desk.

## Notes
Remember to follow up with engineering team tomorrow AM about implementation timeline estimates. They're usually available 9-10 AM.

The reframing around customer pain points is a keeper - apply this lens to future proposals too.
